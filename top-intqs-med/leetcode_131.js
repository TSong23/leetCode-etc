/*
Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.

Example:

Input: "aab"
Output:
[
  ["aa","b"],
  ["a","a","b"]
]

data struc: 2d arr
suggests that i use recursion and each end point returns an array

this is a really hard problem
