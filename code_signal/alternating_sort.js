/* 

You are given an array of integers a.A new array b is generated by rearranging the elements of a in the following way:

b[0] is equal to a[0];
b[1] is equal to the last element of a;
b[2] is equal to a[1];
b[3] is equal to the second - last element of a;
and so on.
Your task is to determine whether the new array b is sorted in strictly ascending order or not.

For a = [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2], the output should be alternatingSort(a) = true.

The new array b will look like[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], which is in strictly ascending order, so the answer is true.

For a = [1, 4, 5, 6, 3], the output should be alternatingSort(a) = false.

The new array b will look like[1, 3, 4, 6, 5], which is not in strictly ascending order, so the answer is false.
