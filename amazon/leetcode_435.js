// Input: [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 3]]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: [1, 3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non - overlapping.

// Input: [[1, 2], [2, 3]]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non - overlapping.


// [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 3]]. removing [1,3] rather than [1,2], [2,3]
// [1, 3] covers more distance, so preferable to remove this one. this is condition for removal





// Brute force way: 

var eraseOverlapIntervals = function (intervals) {


};
